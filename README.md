### Popularity of Economics vs Computer Science at Harvard

Every fall Harvard sophomores must choose a field of study by declaring their concentration or major. For many students this is a key decision that shapes much of their college experience. We wanted to better understand which majors students were choosing and how the popularity of a given field of study has changed over time. In the process we discovered that the number of economics concentrators (the most popular concentration) declined sharply following the 2007 financial crisis. On the other hand more students became interested in computer science following the inception of David Malan's popular CS50 course. 

Below is a infographic we designed that illustrates this finding.
