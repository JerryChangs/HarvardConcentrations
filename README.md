# Harvard Concentrations

#Description

Every fall Harvard sophomores must choose a field of study by declaring their concentration or major. We created a data visualization of the number of students within each major from 2000-2012 in order to better understand the popularity of each field of study and how that has changed over time. In the process we discovered that the number of economics concentrators declined sharply after the 2007 financial crisis while the number of students choosing computer science increased following the inception of David Malan's CS50 course. 

Below is a infographic we created to illustrate this finding.
