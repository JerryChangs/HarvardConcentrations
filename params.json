For many students this is a key decision that shapes much of their college experience. We wanted to better understand which majors students were choosing and how the popularity of a given field of study has changed over time. In the process we discovered that the number of economics concentrators (the most popular concentration) declined sharply following the 2007 financial crisis. On the other hand more students became interested in computer science following the inception of David Malan's popular CS50 course. \r\n\r\nBelow is a infographic we designed that illustrates this finding.\r\n\r\n![Economics vs Computer Science Majors](/EconomicsVsComputerScience.jpg?raw=true \"Economics vs Computer Science\")\r\n\r\n## Interactive Visualization: Trends of Harvard Degrees Conferred\r\n\r\nFor our initial data exploration, we used python to scrape and compile data from various online sources of the number of students in each concentration from 2000-2012. We used Tableu to previsualize the data before sketching and implementing an interactive visualization using D3.  \r\n\r\n<a href=\"/ProcessBook1.pdf\">First Process Book</a>\r\n\r\n### Extending the Visualization \r\n\r\nWith our initial design complete, we experimented with a new design to tell the story of the data. Specifically we enabled users to drill in on the trends of a particular concentration while also comparing the popularity amongs all the concentrations. \r\n\r\n<a href=\"/ProcessBook2.pdf\">Second Process Book</a>\r\n\r\n",
